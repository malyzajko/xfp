This project is set up to compile and run with sbt (simple-build-tool).
You can of course use any other tools, all the source files are in the
directory src/.


How to compile with sbt
==========================
In the directory analysis_tool (where you find build.sbt) type "sbt",
assuming sbt is installed on your system. This starts sbt in interactive mode.
Once sbt has installed on the necessary files, you get a prompt,
where typing "compile" compiles everything it finds in src/
and puts the binaries into target/.

(Note, that sbt automatically creates a project/ directory which you can ignore.)

How to create a jar file
==========================
In the sbt prompt, type "package". You'll find the .jar file somewhere
in the depths of target/.


How to run
==========================
There are several runnable Main files in the project. If you type "run"
in sbt, they will all be listed, and you can select one to run by typing
the appropriate number (the order may be different on your machine):
  [1] xfp.simulation.TestExamples
  [2] TestMain
  [3] XfpMain
  [4] ExprEnumeration


- XfpMain is the standard command line interface to the analysis tool.
  You can get the options with "run -help" and selecting 3 (or your number
  corresponding to XfpMain).

To run a standard analysis on one of the examples in inputs/ type the following:
run -a -code ../inputs/pitch/pitch_out1.txt -inputs ../inputs/pitch/pitch_out_inputs

*  -a is the option to just do the analysis and print the max. errors
    alternatively -c will generate C-style fixed-point code and -s Scala like code
* -code precedes the path to where the code is
    alternatively, if you just provide an expression, use the -expr switch
* -inputs precedes the path to the input variables' ranges and formats


- ExprEnumeration is a short tool for enumerating all rewriting of an expression.
  It takes as input one file containg the expression you want to enumerate
  and prints the result to the console.
  So for instance, you will find the file test.txt in the current directory,
  then you can type 'run test.txt' in sbt, select the number of ExprEnumeration
  and you'll find the generated expressions on your screen.
